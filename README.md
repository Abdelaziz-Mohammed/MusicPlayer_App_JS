# MusicPlayer_App_JS
HTML, CSS, and JS MusicPlayer_App_JS at my learning journey. The tenth project from 30_Days_With_30_Projects learning journey.


## Music Player App
This project is a Music Player Application that allows users to play, pause, and navigate through a playlist of songs. 
It provides an interactive user interface with dynamic song updates, progress tracking, and playback controls.

## Features
- Play and pause functionality for audio files.
- Navigate to the previous or next song in the playlist.
- Display the current song's name and update dynamically as songs change.
- Visual representation of progress with a progress bar that updates as the song plays.
- Manual control over song progress via the slider.
- Looping of songs when playing.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the app structure and audio element integration.
- **CSS**: For styling the player interface, buttons, and progress bar.
- **JavaScript**: For handling song playback, dynamic updates, and user interactions.
- **Font Awesome**: For using icons such as play, pause, forward, and backward controls.

## How to Use
1. Open the app.
2. Use the play/pause button to start or stop the current song.
3. Click on the forward (>>) or backward (<<) buttons to navigate through the playlist.
4. The progress bar shows the current playback time and allows you to manually adjust the song's position.
5. Songs will loop continuously unless paused.
